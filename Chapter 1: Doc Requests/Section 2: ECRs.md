# Engineering Change Request Protocols for Documentation

> **NOTE:** This document outlines the purpose and the functionality of document requests submitted via ECRs. These ECRs should be visible via the two (2) windows created in the [previous section](https://github.com/taddieken95/Accuray_Tech_Comm_Guide/blob/master/Chapter%201:%20Doc%20Requests/Section%201:%20Manufacturing%20Doc%20Requests.md) of this [chapter](https://github.com/taddieken95/Accuray_Tech_Comm_Guide/tree/master/Chapter%201:%20Doc%20Requests).

## What are ECRs?

*ECR* is an acronym for *Engineering Change Request* and is the vehicle through which an Accuray SME makes a request for a change to happen. An Accuray technical writer should only be concerned with ECRs for the following two (2) reasons:

* Documentation Requests
* Initial **Rev. A** release of a work instruction (disregard this for now, this will be touched on later)

Your documentation request ECRs *should* be arriving via the two (2) windows created in your Agile dashboard. Contact IT / Doc Services if this does not appear to be the case.

## What do Documentation Request ECRs consist of?

Similar to all variations of ECRs, a documentation request ECR will provide the technical writer with an overview of the change and why these changes are being requested. The overview of the change can be found inside the **Description of Change:** section on the **Cover Page** of the ECR, and the rationale behind the change is found in the **Reason for Change:** section immediately below the **Description of Change:**. These will provide context, but will likely not contain all the necessary specifics for what needs to be updated.

For the specifics, you should go to the **Attachments** tab inside the ECR. Here, you should find a PDF / Word document known as a **Redline**. A **Redline** will specifically layout all of the changes that an SME desires for the documents. Be sure to follow these redlines closely, as Doc Services will closely analyze the changes made to your document and verify that they match the redlines attached.

> **NOTE:** If additional changes are created inside the document, notify the corresponding SME so that they may update the redlines accordingly. Failure to do so may result in a rejected ECO.

## What if an SME doesn't create an ECR?

An SME may choose to e-mail or physically hand you redlines, though an ECR will still need to be created, as they are required by Doc Services in order for the ECO to be approved. 

If the SME has not created an ECR, do one of the following:

* Contact the SME and request the generate an ECR ***or***
* Create your own ECR and attach it to the SME's ECO

### Creating an ECR

In order to create your own ECR, do the following:

1. Go to the **Create New** dropdown menu at the top of the Agile screen.
2. Go to **Changes** and then click **Change Requests**.
3. Populate the **Description of Change**, **Reason For Change**, and **Product Line(s)** tabs. Then, click **Save** at the bottom-right corner of the window.
4. Once the ECR is created, attach all affected documents / items to the **Affected Items** tab.
5. If an ECO has been created, establish a relationship in the **Relationship** tab. Create a rule so that the ECR automatically closes when the ECO is submitted.
6. Attach all redlines in the **Attachments** tab of the ECR.
