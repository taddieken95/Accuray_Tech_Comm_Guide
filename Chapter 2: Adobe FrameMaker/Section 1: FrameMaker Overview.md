# An Overview of Adobe FrameMaker

> This section should be used as a reference for developing an understanding of FrameMaker and why Accuray currently uses it for documentation purposes.

## What is FrameMaker?

FrameMaker is a word processing system developed by Adobe that allows for exporting to PDF documents. 

## Why FrameMaker?

There are a variety of different reasons that FrameMaker is the current word processor of choice! FrameMaker's design allows for images to be called into the document from an external source, rather than being embedded in the document (such as the case with Microsoft Word). From the perspective of file size, this is a very strong feature that makes FrameMaker favorable, as Agile has limited space available for file storage. 

Additionally, while FrameMaker is more rigid than a word proccesor such as Word, that rigidity allows for a more structurely sound document (*think back to all the times you have moved an image in Word over a centimeter and it caused for the whole document to go haywire*).

There's a common phrase people use when describing FrameMaker vs. Word: 

> *Word makes the easy things easy, and the hard things hard. Whereas FrameMaker makes the hard things easy and the easy things hard*. 

This, of course, is purely anecdotal. FrameMaker is not *hard*, per se, but rather the anecdote is drawing attention to the fact that there is a learning curve that comes with FrameMaker, whereas Word is generally perceived as intuitive.

> **ANOTHER ANECDOTE:** Think of it this way, one could probably build a bridge out of some wood they buy at a local lumber yard. They could use this wood, along with general knowledge of bridges, to construct something that looks like a bridge. This may be fine for people walking over it, but would one feel comfortable ***driving*** over it? Odds are, probably not. One would probably want some sort of steel / concrete bridge designed and built by professionals for this sort of functionality. This same notion is applicable to documentation generation. For low volume generation, Microsoft Word is quick and functional. *But for documents containing 50+ pages?* FrameMaker is the much stronger and less time consuming option.

* **

One last reason that FrameMaker is particularly strong is its ability to establish crossreferences. A **crossreference** is a piece of text that is connected to another piece of text / item inside of a document (such as a **Figure**, **Heading**, or **Step Number**). The advantage of using crossreferences is that they automatically update if elements of a document are moved around. This feature saves time and prevents potential headaches that may otherwise arise without crossreferences.
