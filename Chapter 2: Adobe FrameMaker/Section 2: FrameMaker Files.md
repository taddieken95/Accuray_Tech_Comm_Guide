# FrameMaker Files and File Functionality

> **NOTE:** This section provides information regarding how Adobe FrameMaker files operate and function within Accuray Incorporated.

## Structure of FrameMaker File

Accuray's manufacturing work instructions are generated via FrameMaker books. A FrameMaker book is a collective body of individual FrameMaker files. The appeal to this, is the ability to separate sections / chapters of a publication into files that can be easily moved around to different locations within that publication. 

In the context of manufacturing work instructions, a standard FrameMaker book will contain three (3) files:

* **Title Page**
* **Table of Contents**
* **Content**

### Title Page

As mentioned above, the first of the three (3) files is the Title Page. See the table below for descriptions of all the features present in an Accuray Manufacturing work instruction.

| Feature       | Description                                 |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|
|**Title**| The title of the work instruction. Displayed at the top-right corner of the title page|
|**Document Number**|The specialized number for locating the document in Agile. See [this article] for information on how to assign a number.|
|**Revision Table**|A brief outline of each prior revision, consisting of the **Revision Letter**, **Date of Release**, **Description of Change**, and the **Originator(s)**.|
|**Revision Letter**|Labeled as **Rev** in the table, this informs the reader as to when a particular version was released. **Revision Letters** begin at A.|
|**Date of Release**|The date the revision was released in Agile. The most recent revision should say *See Agile*, as the technical writer will not be able to predict which date it will be officially released in Agile.|
|**Description of Change**|A brief, 1-2 sentence summary of the change being made. Rev. A should say *Initial Release*|
|**Originator(s)**| The first initial and last name of the SME(s) & technical writer(s) involved with a stage of release|
|**Materials Required** (optional)|A separate (optional) table below the **Revision Table** that lists the tools and materials involved in performing a work instruction.| 
|**Reference Work Instructions** (optional)|A separate (optional) table below the **Revision Table** (and the **Reference Table**, if present) that lists any corresponding work instructions or SOPs.|

Upon completion, a finished **Title Page** should appear as shown in the image below.

The file name for the **Title Page** will be *(insert document number)_TitlePage.fm* (*ex: **T-MFG-R2000_TitlePage.fm***)

### Table of Contents

The second of the three (3) files is the **Table of Contents**. The **Table of Contents** (also referred to as the **TOC**) is automatically linked to any primary headings throughout the document. See [this article] for information regarding generating / troubleshooting FrameMaker TOCs. A completed **Table of Contents** should contain the following attributes:

* **Document Title**
* **Work Instruction Number**
* **Revision Level**
* **Heading Title** (for each section in the **Contents** file of the FrameMaker book)
* **Section Number** (for each section)
* **Page Number** (for each section)

Upon completion, a finished **Table of Contents** page should appear as shown in the image below.

![alt text](https://github.com/taddieken95/Accuray_Tech_Comm_Guide/blob/master/img/TOC%20Example.png "TOC Example")

The file name for the **Table of Contents** section will be *(insert document number)_TOC.fm* (*ex: **T-MFG-R2000_TOC.fm***)

### Content

As one would likely imagine, the **Content** file contains the procedural content pertaining to the work instruction. The **Content** portion should have a minimum of one (1) section to ensure compliance with the autogenerated **TOC** (if only a single section is created for a work instruction, assign it a title of *Procedure*).

There is no real limit on the number of pages the **Content** file can contain, but it is advisable to use judgement if a work instruction begins to surpass 50+ pages. Specifically, *can / should this work instruction be divided into smaller work instructions*? This is not to say FrameMaker is incapable of handling large documents (as it certainly can!) but rather, would it be doing the technician (your end user) a disservice to have a single document be so long?

The **Content** file should contain the following:

* A **Line Clearance** disclaimer
* An **Ionization Radiation** warning
* An **Electrostatic Discharge (ESD)** warning
* A minimum of one (1) **Heading 1**
* **Procedural Steps**

Due to the proprietary nature of procedural steps, this guide is not able to showcase an example of a **Content** file, however, you should find following the steps in [this section] will produce the necessary result in relation to Accuray's Manufacturing Tech Comm standards (e.g. do not fret about proper formatting, as the FrameMaker template provided will take care of that for you, *another one of the many perks of using FrameMaker instead of Word!*)

The file name for the **Content** section will be *(insert document number)_Content.fm* (*ex: **T-MFG-R2000_Content.fm***)

### Backup Files

The final element of FrameMaker files that is important to take note of is the **Backup File**. **Backup File**s are automatically generated by FrameMaker, and will not appear inside the user interface of the program. One backup file will be autogenerated per file. These backups help to absorb risk in the event that a FrameMaker crash occurs before saving the file.

## Finalized List of Files
