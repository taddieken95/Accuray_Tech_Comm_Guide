# FrameMaker Files and File Functionality

> **NOTE:** This section provides information regarding how Adobe FrameMaker files operate and function within Accuray Incorporated.

## Structure of FrameMaker File

Accuray's manufacturing work instructions are generated via FrameMaker books. A FrameMaker book is a collective body of individual FrameMaker files. The appeal to this, is the ability to separate sections / chapters of a publication into files that can be easily moved around to different locations within that publication. 

In the context of manufacturing work instructions, a standard FrameMaker book will contain three (3) files:

* Title Page
* Table of Contents
* Content

### Title Page

As mentioned above, the first of the three files is the Title Page. See the table below for descriptions of all the features present in an Accuray Manufacturing work instruction.

| Feature       | Description                                 |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|
|**Title**| The title of the work instruction. Displayed at the top-right corner of the title page|

|**Revision Table**|A brief outline of each prior revision, consisting of the **Revision Letter**, **Date of Release**, **Description of Change**, and the **Originator(s)**.|
