# FrameMaker Authoring Interface

> **NOTE:** This section details the various features within Adobe FrameMaker, along with how to author using our unstructured (non-DITA/XML) template.

## Launching FrameMaker

To fully open a FrameMaker file, do the following:

1. Go to the desired FrameMaker file folder location.
2. Double-click the FrameMaker **.book** file. FrameMaker will open.
3. Go to the **Navigation Pane** on the left side of the FrameMaker interface. 
4. Double click each of the three (3) files listed below the **.book** file (**_TitlePage.fm**, **_TOC.fm**, and **_Content.fm**). Each of the three (3) files should now be open. Your interface should look similar to the image displayed below.

## Authoring Options - Paragraph Catalog

A floating side panel featuring the **Paragraph Catalog** should be present inside the FrameMaker interface. If this is not the case, perform the following:

1. Go to the **View** dropdown at the top of the screen.
2. Go to **Pods** then select **Paragraph Catalog**.
3. The sidepanel should now appear. It is likely that additional pods (such as **Variables**, **Character Designer**, and **Cross References**) will appear as well. Ignore these tabs for now and go to the **Paragraph Catalog** tab.

The final result should appear as shown **below**:

These options listed in the **Paragraph Catalog** pod are the different authoring text styles that come with the Accuray Manufacturing FrameMaker template. These, of course, can be stylistically modified through the **Character Designer** tab, but for the majority of work instructions, this list should contain all of the needed elements to producing robust documentation.

## Paragraph Catalog Functionality

The following table will provide an explanation for different features of the **Paragraph Catalog**.
