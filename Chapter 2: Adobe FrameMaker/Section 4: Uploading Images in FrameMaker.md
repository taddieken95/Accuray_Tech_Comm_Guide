# Uploading Images to a Work Instruction in FrameMaker

> **NOTE:** This section will provide details on adding images to Accuray work instruction in Adobe FrameMaker.

## An Overview of How Images in FrameMaker Operate

A notable (and beneficial!) difference between how images operate within Adobe FrameMaker vs. how images operate within Microsoft Word is that Adobe FrameMaker images are not directly embedded in the document itself. Whereas one can copy and paste an image into Word, FrameMaker is reliant on file pathways to present an image. This means that the images "present" within an Adobe FrameMaker work instruction exist in a file location outside of the document itself.

For each Adobe FrameMaker file bundle, a folder titled "Images" should be present. This will be the file pathway destination for all relevant images within the work instruction, and should be included with the final .zip file produced. 

While this may be a tad confusing for beginners, the benifets lie in file size reduction. Relying on file pathways removes clutter inside a FrameMaker file, making it less prone to crash (though, saving often is still recommended best practice, see [this section]() for more information on authoring best practices).
