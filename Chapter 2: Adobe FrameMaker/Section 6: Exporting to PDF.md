# Exporting to PDF

> This section will provide details on exporting a FrameMaker file to a PDF. It is worth noting that the user should not need to perform this task until they are finished with a document draft.

To export a FrameMaker file to a PDF, do the following:

1. Go to the FrameMaker file panel and select the .book file

> **NOTE:** It **must** be the .book file that is selected. Failure to do so may cause FrameMaker to export only the current file to a PDF (i.e. - the Title Page file, TOC file, or Content File).
2. Go to the **File** dropdown menu. Click **Save as PDF...**
3. Ensure the Agile Work Instruction Number is the **File Name**. Click **Save**
4. A **PDF Setup for Selected Files** dialog box will appear. Click **Set**.

> **NOTE:** A **Confirm Security** dialog box may appear that says, *Are you sure that this file is from a trustworthy source and you want to convert it?*. Click **Yes**.

5. Your PDF file should now be created and available for view inside an **Acrobat Distiller** window (this window should appear automatically). To view the file, double-click it. Ensure all needed attributes are present in your PDF (see [this chapter](https://github.com/taddieken95/Accuray_Tech_Comm_Guide/blob/master/Chapter%204:%20Proofreading/READme.md) for more information regarding proofreading Accuray documents).
