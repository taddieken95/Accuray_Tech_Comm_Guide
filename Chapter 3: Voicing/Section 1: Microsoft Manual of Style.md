# Microsoft Manual of Style for Technical Communication

> **NOTE:** This section provides an overview of some of the more important best practice take-aways from the [Microsoft Manual of Style for Technical Communication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/). This Section does not contain every aspect of the Microsoft Manual of Style, but rather highlights the most important aspects for Accuray Technical Communication.

## Voicing Principles

The *Microsoft Style Guide* recommends three guiding principles on voicing:

* **Warm and Relaxed**
* **Crisp and Clear**
* **Ready to Lend a Hand**

It should be noted, however, that for our purposes in writing per regulatory standards, a **Warm and Relaxed** tone should not be the crux of our writing. This is not to say we should write in a way that feels robotic, but rather we should understand that the **Crispy and Clear** and **Ready to Lend a Hand** principles should be priority.

Perform the following in order to accomplish these voicing principles:

* **Get to the point fast.** *Start with the key takeaway. Put the most important thing in the most noticeable spot. Make choices and next steps obvious. Give people just enough information to make decisions confidently. Don't get in the way.*

* **Simpler is better.** *Everyone likes clarity and getting to the point. Break it up. Steup it out. Layer. Short sentences and fragments are easier to scan and read. Prune every excess word.*

* **Place yourself in the end user's shoes.** *Consider all the ways in which an audience could receive your instructions. What level of knowledge might they possess when performing this process? Ensure ALL information is provided that could be of use. **It is always easier to remove unnecessary content at a later revision than to perform a task without all the content present.***

## Acronyms

If you've spent any time at Accuray, you're probably well aware of the fact that we use a *lot* of acronyms (see [this section]() for a comprehensive guide to acronyms at Accuray). Follow the following guidelines when referencing acronyms in documentation:

* **Spell out the term for clarity.** It is best practice to type out the meaning of an acronym before solely referencing an acronym in a document.

> **EXAMPLE:** *The Multi-Leaf Collimator (MLC) is a crucial aspect of dose delivery to patients. The MLC is assembled here at 1209 Deming Way.*

* **Don't introduce acronyms that are only used once.** If an acronym is only referenced once in a document, it is better to simply spell it out.

* **Avoid acronyms in titles and headings.** Especially if this is the first time an acronym is being referred to in a document. Acronyms in titles or headings can confuse the End User.

* **

* **Don't create acronyms that have not been officially established from Engineering.** It is important to remember that we are not the SME, and that acronyms we generate have the potential to confuse the End User. *Only* reference acronyms that have been recognized by Engineering.
