# Microsoft Manual of Style for Technical Communication

> **NOTE:** This section provides an overview of some of the more important best practice take-aways from the [Microsoft Manual of Style for Technical Communication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/). This Section does not contain every aspect of the Microsoft Manual of Style, but rather highlights the most important aspects for Accuray Technical Communication.

## Voicing Principles

The *Microsoft Style Guide* recommends three guiding principles on voicing:

* **Warm and Relaxed**
* **Crisp and Clear**
* **Ready to Lend a Hand**

It should be noted, however, that for our purposes in writing per regulatory standards, a **Warm and Relaxed** tone should not be the crux of our writing. This is not to say we should write in a way that feels robotic, but rather we should understand that the **Crisp and Clear** and **Ready to Lend a Hand** principles should be priority.

Perform the following in order to accomplish these voicing principles:

* **Get to the point fast.** *Start with the key takeaway. Put the most important thing in the most noticeable spot. Make choices and next steps obvious. Give people just enough information to make decisions confidently. Don't get in the way.*

* **Simpler is better.** *Everyone likes clarity and getting to the point. Break it up. Step it out. Layer. Short sentences and fragments are easier to scan and read. Prune every excess word.*

* **Place yourself in the End User's shoes.** *Consider all the ways in which an audience could receive your instructions. What level of knowledge might they possess when performing this process? Ensure ALL information is provided that could be of use. **It is always easier to remove unnecessary content at a later revision than to perform a task without all the content present.***

## Acronyms

If you've spent any time at Accuray, you're probably well aware of the fact that we use a *lot* of acronyms (see [this section]() for a comprehensive guide to acronyms at Accuray). Follow the following guidelines when referencing acronyms in documentation:

* **Spell out the term for clarity.** It is best practice to type out the meaning of an acronym before solely referencing an acronym in a document.

> **EXAMPLE:** *The Multi-Leaf Collimator (MLC) is a crucial aspect of dose delivery to patients. The MLC is assembled here at 1209 Deming Way.*

* **Don't introduce acronyms that are only used once.** If an acronym is only referenced once in a document, it is better to simply spell it out.

* **Avoid acronyms in titles and headings.** Especially if this is the first time an acronym is being referred to in a document. Acronyms in titles or headings can confuse the End User.

* **Avoid the possessive form.** Avoid any anthromorphisms in general in the realm of Technical Communication.

* **Don't create acronyms that have not been officially established from Engineering.** It is important to remember that we are not the SME, and that acronyms we generate have the potential to confuse the End User. *Only* reference acronyms that have been recognized by Engineering.


## Gender-Free Communication

> **NOTE:** This section is in tangent with the *Bias-free Communication* section of the *Microsoft Style Guide*; however, it has been slightly repurposed to specifically touch on the needs of Accuray technical communication.

A large aspect of writing with the End User in mind is considering the multitude of backgrounds they may come from. It is because of this that the Accuray technical writer should seek to write in a manner that is free of bias. Consider the following when attempting to write bias-free communication:

### Use gender-neutral alternatives for common terms.

|**Use this**| **In place of this**|
|------------|---------------------|
|chair, moderator| chairman|
|operates, staffs| mans|
|workforce, staff, personnel|manpower|

### Don't use *he, him, his, she, her*, or *hers* in generic references

Instead:

* Rewrite to use a generic third person, such as *the operator* or *the technician*

> **NOTE:** *Microsoft Manual of Style* recommends the use of second person. However, at this time, Accuray standards and practices still recommend against this practice. **Do not use the second person in writing Accuray documentation.**

* Use *person* or *individual*
* Rewrite the sentence to have a plural noun and pronoun

> **NOTE:** If it is not possible to write around the problem, it is acceptable to use a plural pronoun (they, their, or them) in generic reference to a single person.


## Grammar and Parts of Speech

### Verbs

The prevailing rule of thumb for verb usage in technical documentation is **using precise verbs in the right way helps you to write clear and simple sentences.** Consider the following when it comes to the use of verbs in technical documentation:

#### Verb Tense

In the present tense, the action is happening now. The present tense is often easier to read and understand than the past or future tense. It is the best choice for most content.

#### Active and Passive Voice

The mood of a verb expresses the writer's intent. Most of the time, use the indiciative mood. It's crisp and straightforward without being bossy. Don't switch moods within a sentence.

|**Mood**|**Use for**|**Examples**|
|--------|-----------|------------|
|**Indicative**|Statements of fact, questions, assertions, and explanations|Style sheets are powerful tools for formatting complex documents.|
|**Imperative**|Instructions, procedures, direct commands, requests, and headings for columns that list customer actions (*this will likely be most of the content used in your Accuray technical documentation*)|Enter a file name, then save the file.|
|**Subjunctive**|Wishes, hypotheses, and suggestions (**AVOID THESE, unless providing an optional "Tip"**)|We recommend that you be careful about opening email attachments.|

Voice is either active or passive. Keep it active when possible.

* In active voice, the subject of the sentence performs the action.
* In passive voice, the subject is the receiver of the action.

#### Verb Agreement

Verbs have singular and plural forms. Use the verb form that agrees with the subject of the sentence in number.

* **A group of things:** The verb is singular
* **Two or more singular things connected by *and*:** The verb is plural
* **Two or more singular things connected by *or*:** The verb is Singular
* **A singular thing and a plural thing connected by *or*:** Singular or plural, to match the closest subject

### Capitalization and Proper Nouns

Proper nouns are one of a kind - unique people, places, and things. Capitalize proper nouns wherever they occur.

Proper nouns include:

* Names and titles of individuals
* Unique, named places, organizations, events, shows, corporate and philanthropic programs, and other things
* Product, service, app, and tool names
* Trademarks
* Titles of books, songs, and other published works
* Managed standards, such us Bluetooth

If there's more than one of a thing, it's a common noun. For example, there are lots of chief operating officers, so *chief operating officer* is a common noun. There is only one *Accuray Inc., Chief Operating Officer*, so that's a proper noun.

Don't capitalize common nouns unless they begin a sentence or the situation calls for title-style capitalization. Most technology concepts, product categories, devices, and features are common nouns - not proper nouns. 

Capitalize technology terms as proper nouns only when:

* You need to distinguish a component or product, such as CyberKnife Linear Accelerator, from a general technology with a similar name, such as a linear accelerator.
* The terms are typically capitalized in the industry. Search [The American Heritage Dictionary](https://ahdictionary.com/), reputable internet sites, and industry-specific dictionaries. **Do not rely on unedited websites.**

## Word Choice

### Use simple words, concise sentences

Make every word count. Concise, clear sentences save sapce, are easy to understand, and facilitate scanning. Use simple words with precise meanings, and remove words that don't add substance. Use proper judgement to avoid sounding abrupt.

* Choose simple verbs without modifiers. Avoid weak or vague verbs such as *be, have, make* and *do*.

|**Use this**|**Not this**|
|------------|------------|
|use|utilize, make use of|
|remove|extract, take away, eliminate|
|tell|inform, let know|
|right, left|right-hand, left-hand|

* Don't use two (2) or three (3) words when one will do.

|**Use this**|**Not this**|
|------------|------------|
|to|in order to, as a means to|
|also|in addition|               
|connect|establish connectivity|

* Whenever possible, choose words that have one (1) clear meaning

|**Use this**|**Not this**|
|------------|------------|
|*Because* you created the table, you can change it.|*Since* you created the table, you can change it.|

* Omit unnecessary adverbs - words that describe how, when, or where. Unless they're important to the meaning of a statement, leave them out.

**Examples:**
quite
very
quickly
easily
effectively

* Use one (1) term consistently to represent one (1) concept.

* Use words that can be both nouns and verbs carefully - *file, post, mark, screen, record,* and *report*, for example. Use the sentence structure and context to eliminate ambiguity.
