## Anthropomorphisms

> **NOTE:** The following subsection is taken from the *Microsoft Manual of Style*.

**Anthropomorphism** is the attribution of human characteristics or behavior to things that are not human. In technical writing, there is an understandable temptation to anthropomorphize in order to make difficult material easier for the reader to relate to. *Do not succumb to this temptation*. 

Because **anthropomorphism** is a form of metaphor, it can cause the same readability problems as other forms of metaphor. Not all readers will grasp the limits of the metaphor.

**Anthropomorphism** in technical writing is often the result of an imprecise or incomplete understanding of the topic at hand. Although **anthromorphism** might help *you* work toward a clearer understanding, the content should reflect the result, but not the process, of *your* learning.

### Correct

If you receive a confirmation message, the engine will store your data in the specified format.

### Incorrect

If you receive a confirmation message, the engine will behave as you requested.

Sometimes terminology forces **anthropomorphism** upon us. For example, in a hierarchical relationship, a child object is said to inherit attributes from its parent or ancestors. If, as in this case, the anthropomorphic metaphor is well-established and limited, and its limitations are clear, go ahead and use it - taking care to explain what some readers may not understand about the metaphor. Straining to avoid such usage would likely introduce more confusion that the metaphor itself, especially among initiated readers.

Be skeptical of established usage, though. If **anthropomorphism** is not the predominant way a concept is expressed in edited publications or on websites, find another way to express the concept.

Sometimes the user interface or application programming interface of a feature is anthropomorphic. In dealing with wizards, assistants, guides, and other characters built into a program, you must let your professional judgment guide you in deciding how much the documentation should reinforce the **anthropomorphism** of the feature. Do not use words or phrases that convey intention or desire (such as *refuses*, *wants*, or *is interested in*), intellect (*thinks*, *knows*, *realizes*), or emotion (*likes*).

### Correct

The speech recognition engine accepts only the following words.

Documents manage data; views display the data and accept operations on it.

### Incorrect

The speech recognition engine is interested only in the following words.

Documents know how to manage data; views know how to display the data and accept operations on it.

## Words to Watch Out For

The following words may be acceptable in the right context, but they often signal inappropriate **anthropomorphism**. Some are appropriate only for programmers or information technology professionals.
