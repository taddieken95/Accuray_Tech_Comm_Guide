# Title Page Proofreading

> **NOTE:** This section will provide more in-depth guidance for the Title Page proofreading checklist previously discussed in [Section 1: Document Submission Readiness Checklist](https://github.com/taddieken95/Accuray_Tech_Comm_Guide/blob/master/Chapter%204:%20Proofreading/Section%201:%20Document%20Submission%20Readiness%20Checklist.md).

## Title Page Checklist Overview

* Title matches title in Agile
* Correct document number and revision letter
* Correct and complete revision history table
* ECO number listed in revision history table is correct
* Bottom margins have FRM 1049647, Rev. C
* Bottom margins have updated page number
* Date column has been updated for all prior revisions (the date column for the revision in progress should state *See Agile*, all others should have the date of release listed)

### FrameMaker Title Matches Title in Agile

All Accuray work instruction titles must match the document title in Agile, verbatim. There are two (2) ways to ensure this is the case:

* Change the work instruction title inside of the work instruction
* Change the Agile title inside of the ECO

Either method is perfectly acceptable. There may be situations in which a work instruction is slightly repurposed and requires a revision to the title. To change the title in Agile, perform the following:

1. Go to the ECO responsible for the change being created.
2. Go to the **Affected Items** tab.
3. Go to the row corresponding to this work instruction.
4. Double click the box in the **Item Description** column (not the **Old Item Description**).
5. Change the Agile title to match the new desired WI title.

Alternatively, if the title is correct in Agile and the FrameMaker file title is incorrect, simply change the title in FrameMaker by going to the **Variables** pod (see [Chapter 2: Adobe FrameMaker](https://github.com/taddieken95/Accuray_Tech_Comm_Guide/blob/master/Chapter%202:%20Adobe%20FrameMaker/READme.md) for more information on FrameMaker authoring tips and procedures).

### Correct Document Number and Revision Letter

Ensure both the document number and the revision letter in the FrameMaker file match the document number and revision letter in Agile. Both can be changed in the **Variables** pod (see [Chapter 2: Adobe FrameMaker](https://github.com/taddieken95/Accuray_Tech_Comm_Guide/blob/master/Chapter%202:%20Adobe%20FrameMaker/READme.md) for more information on FrameMaker authoring tips and procedures).

### Correct and Complete Revision History Table

Check Agile to make sure the **Revision Letter**, **ECO Number**, and **Date** columns all match the revision history in Agile. This can be checked by pulling up the document in Agile and going to the **Changes** tab. All required information will be listed here.

> **NOTE:** The second-most recent revision row in the Revision History Table will have *See Agile* displayed in the **Date** column. Change it corresponding release date in Agile.

### Bottom Margins Say FRM 1049647, Rev. C

Make sure the bottom margin displays **FRM 10469647, Rev. C**. If it displays anything else (such as Rev. A or Rev. B), make sure the proper form is being used and then perform the following:

1. Go to the **View** dropdown menu at the top of the screen.
2. Select **Master Pages** (two pages should be displayed).
3. Select the text displaying the incorrect form number with your cursor and change it to **FRM 1049647, Rev. C**.
4. Repeat this for the other page.
5. Go back to the **View** dropdown menu and select **Body Pages**. This will return you to the standard document view with an updated bottom margin.
