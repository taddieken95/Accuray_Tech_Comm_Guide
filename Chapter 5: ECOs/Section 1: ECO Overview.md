# Engineering Change Order Overview

> **NOTE:** This section will provide information regarding the purpose and functionality of Engineering Change Orders (ECOs) in Accuray's Agile PLM system.

## "What are ECOs?"

ECOs are the means through which changes are implemented inside of Agile PLM. In a sense, they are the compliment to the ECR. Where ECRs generate a request for an action to be performed - ECOs implement the action being requested.  

In terms of documentation, you will receive an ECR when a change is needed (see [Chapter 1: Documentation Requests](https://github.com/taddieken95/Accuray_Tech_Comm_Guide/blob/master/Chapter%201:%20Doc%20Requests/READme.md) for more information on the process), and will use an ECO to upload the new version of the work instruction.

## "How are ECOs Approved?"

Upon submittal, ECOs are reviewed by the Doc Services department of Accuray. This is a specialized team of documentarians whose job is to ensure the changes made in an ECO are compliant with Accuray and regulatory standards. Should any changes fail to meet Doc Services' criteria, the ECO will be rejected. A checklist for Doc Services' criteria will be provided later in this chapter.

## "Who is Responsible for ECOs?"

Short answer, *it depends*! In standard practice, it is likely most advisable to have the SME take care of generating and populating the ECO, as the SME will have more knowledge regarding the production line implications of a change.

However, that's not to say that Accuray technical writers *never* create ECO. Often times you will come across changes that solely effect the documentation itself, with no changes to the production process. It is in such cases that it may be most effeceint and effective for the technical writer to create the ECO themself (such cases could be: typos, template changes, modifications to existing templates).
