# Creating ECOs

> **NOTE:** This section will provide step-by-step instructions on creating your own ECO in Agile. It should be noted that if this ECO is to implemement a process change in production, a technical writer may not be the ideal individual to populate the ECO. Use proper discretion and seek input from managers if unsure about how to proceed.

As mentioned in the note above, the first thing an Accuray technical writer should do is consider whether or not they should be responsible for ownership of this ECO. It is possible to pull an ECO, and then have the corresponding SME be responsible for its population; however, it is best practice to ensure the SME is on board with this before pulling. For purposes of explanation, we will assume that the technical writer possesses ownership of the ECO. 

Perform the following to create an ECO:

1. Open Agile PLM in your OKTA dashboard and go to the **Create New** dropdown at the top of the screen.
2. Go to **Changes** and then select **Change Order**. A window for the creation of a change order will appear.
3. Ensure **ECO** is selected in the **Type:** dropdown menu.

> The ECO number will be automatically assigned by Agile. Take note of this number, which is featured in the **Number:** section of the change order window.

4. Select **Product Doc** from the **Change Type:** dropdown menu.
5. Provide a brief description of the changes being made to each document in the **Description of Change:** section.
6. Provide an overview of the reasoning / rationale behind the update in the **Reason for Change:** section.
7. Select **CyberKnife** / **TomoTherapy** / or **Common** (if update is applicable to both) for the **Product Line(s):** section.
8. Select the appropriate project in the **Related Project:** section (or **NA** if there is not a company-wide project this release is applicable to).
9. Once all fields are populated, click **Save** at the bottom-right section of the screen

> The **Save** and **Cancel** buttons may not be visible if the change order window is not in full screen mode

The ECO has now been created; however, further steps are required in order for the ECO to be submission-ready. The **Change Solution:**, **Input Requirements Risk Mitigations and Regulatory Impact:**, and **Verification Validation and Design Transfer:** sections on the cover page must be populated before submittal. *These* are the sections where it is important to have an SME provide information, as they correspond to the downstream effects caused in production that the technical writer may not possess knowledge of.
