# Creating ECOs

> **NOTE:** This section will provide step-by-step instructions on creating your own ECO in Agile. It should be noted that if this ECO is to implemement a process change in production, a technical writer may not be the ideal individual to populate the ECO. Use proper discretion and seek input from managers if unsure about how to proceed.

As mentioned in the note above, the first thing an Accuray technical writer should do is consider whether or not they should be responsible for ownership of this ECO. It is possible to pull an ECO, and then have the corresponding SME be responsible for its population; however, it is best practice to ensure the SME is on board with this before pulling. For purposes of explanation, we will assume that the technical writer possesses ownership of the ECO. 

Perform the following to create an ECO:

1. Open Agile PLM in your OKTA dashboard and go to the **Create New** dropdown at the top of the screen.
2. Go to **Changes** and then select **Change Order**. A window for the creation of a change order will appear.
3. Ensure **ECO** is selected in the **Type:** dropdown menu.

> The ECO number will be automatically assigned by Agile. Take note of this number, which is featured in the **Number:** section of the change order window.

4. Select **Product Doc** from the **Change Type:** dropdown menu.
5.
