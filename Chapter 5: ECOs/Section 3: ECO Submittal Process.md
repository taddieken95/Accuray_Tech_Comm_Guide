# ECO Submittal

> This section provides further details on the ECO submittal process, along with providing more information regarding additional documents needed for proper submittal.

## Uploading Documents to an ECO

First and foremost, we must ensure that our work instructions are uploaded to the ECO. To upload work instructions to an ECO, perform the following:

1. Go to the **Affected Items** tab of your ECO.
2. If there are currently no items in the **Affected Items** tab, add them by clicking **Add** and then entering the corresponding WI numbers.
3. Click the WI number in the **Item Number** column, you will be redirected to that item number in Agile. 
4. Go to the **Attachments** tab and click **Add**. An **Add Files** window will appear.
5. Upload the PDF and .zip file. Assign a description of *Native File* to the .zip file and *PDF Release* to the PDF file.
6. Click **Add**. The files will now be uploaded. Repeat Steps 1-5 for any additional WIs involved in your ECO.
7. Upon completion, return to the **Affected Items** tab of your ECO. Ensure each of the applicable columns are populated.

> Populate the remaining columns for each item listed in your ECO (**New Lifecycle Phase** through **Initial Base**. Except in particular situations, **New Lifcycle Phase** should be set to **Released**, **1st Article Required** should be set to **No**, and **On Order** through **Install Base** should be set to **Not Applicable**. Additionally, ensure your new revision letter level is inputed in the **New Rev** column.

## Establishing Relationships

It is important to establish relationships between ECRs and ECOs in order to ensure Agile does not become cluttered with ECRs that have already been completed. To establish a relationship, perform the following:

1. Go to the **Relationships** tab of the ECO.
2. Click **Add**, then click **By Search**. A Search window will appear.
3. Enter in the ECR number in the search bar. Double-click the ECR when it appears.

> The ECR must be in a **Pending** state to be assigned a relationship. If it is in a **Submitted** state, send it back to **Pending** yourself by going to the **Workflow** tab and clicking the green **Pending** box in the **Summary (Default Change Requests)** section. A Change Status to Pending window will appear. It is not necessary to notify any users, but you can if you desire. Click **Finish** to send to **Pending**

> If the ECR is in **CCB** status, it will require Doc Services to be submitted back to pending. Contact via e-mail.

4. Assign a rule causing the ECR to be set to *Close* when the ECO is released.
5. Click **Save** to implement the new rule.

## Forms to Attach

If uploading a Rev. A release of a work instruction, be sure to attach FRM 1063996 in the **Attachments** tab of the ECO. If you are creating updates to a previously existing document, use FRM 033017

> Both of these forms are found in Agile, and will contain instructions on how to populate them.
