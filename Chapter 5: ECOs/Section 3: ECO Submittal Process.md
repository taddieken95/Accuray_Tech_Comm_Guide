# ECO Submittal

> This section provides further details on the ECO submittal process, along with providing more information regarding additional documents needed for proper submittal.

## Uploading Documents to an ECO

First and foremost, we must ensure that our work instructions are uploaded to the ECO. To upload work instructions to an ECO, perform the following:

1. Go to the **Affected Items** tab of your ECO.
2. If there are currently no items in the **Affected Items** tab, add them by clicking **Add** and then entering the corresponding WI numbers.
3. Click the WI number in the **Item Number** column, you will be redirected to that item number in Agile. 
4. Go to the **Attachments** tab and click **Add**. An **Add Files** window will appear.
5. Upload the PDF and .zip file. Assign a description of *Native File* to the .zip file and *PDF Release* to the PDF file.
6. Click **Add**. The files will now be uploaded. Repeat Steps 1-5 for any additional WIs involved in your ECO.
7. Upon completion, return to the **Affected Items** tab of your ECO. Ensure each of the applicable columns are populated.

Populate the remaining columns for each item listed in your ECO (**New Lifecycle Phase** through **Initial Base**). Except in particular situations, **New Lifcycle Phase** should be set to **Released**, **1st Article Required** should be set to **No**, and **On Order** through **Install Base** should be set to **Not Applicable**. 

Additionally, ensure your new revision letter level is listed in the **New Rev** column.

## Establishing Relationships

It is important to establish relationships between ECRs and ECOs in order to ensure Agile does not become cluttered with ECRs that have already been completed. To establish a relationship, perform the following:

1. Go to the **Relationships** tab of the ECO.
2. Click **Add**, then click **By Search**. A Search window will appear.
3. Enter in the ECR number in the search bar. Double-click the ECR when it appears.

> **NOTE:** The ECR must be in a **Pending** state to be assigned a relationship. If it is in a **Submitted** state, send it back to **Pending** yourself by going to the **Workflow** tab and clicking the green **Pending** box in the **Summary (Default Change Requests)** section. A Change Status to Pending window will appear. It is not necessary to notify any users, but you can if you desire. Click **Finish** to send to **Pending**

> **NOTE:** If the ECR is in **CCB** status, it will require Doc Services to be submitted back to pending. Contact via e-mail.

4. Assign a rule causing the ECR to be set to *Close* when the ECO is released.
5. Click **Save** to implement the new rule.

## Forms to Attach

If uploading a Rev. A release of a work instruction, be sure to attach FRM 1063996 in the **Attachments** tab of the ECO. If you are creating updates to a previously existing document, use FRM 033017

> **NOTE:** Both of these forms are found in Agile, and will contain instructions on how to populate them.

## Submitting the ECO

Once all required documents are attached and fields are populated, it is time to submit the ECO. To submit an ECO for further review from doc services, perform the following:

1. Go to the **Next Status** dropdown menu on the ECO page.
2. Click **Submitted**. A Select Workflow window will appear.
3. Click **Continue** at the bottom-right of the window.
4. Add any individual you wish to notify in the **To:** section. Provide context in the **Comments:** section.
5. Click **Finish**, the ECO is now submitted for Doc Services approval.

Following submittal of an ECO, you can add reviewers to provide feedback in addition to Doc Services. It is best practice to include the SME with any work instruction update. Additional people also often added for approval include Quality personnel and the technician(s) who uses the instruction. Add reviewers by going to the **Workflow** tab and clicking **Add Reviewers**.

You will be able to track your ECO's progress inside the **Workflow** tab as well. The order of workflow is **Pending** > **Submitted** > **Change Control Board** > **Released** > **Implemented**. Alternatively, an ECO can be cancelled at any point during the submittal process.
